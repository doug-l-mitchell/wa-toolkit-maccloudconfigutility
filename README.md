Deprecated

##This Toolkit is now deprecated and is superseded by [Windows Azure Mobile Services](http://www.windowsazure.com/ios).

The Windows Azure Toolkit for iOS provided developers with the first iteration of support for building backend services for iOS apps using Windows Azure.  The main areas of feedback we received from mobile developers was that they wanted a turn-key set of services for common functionality such as notifications, auth, and data.  [Windows Azure Mobile Services](http://www.windowsazure.com/ios) directly reflects this feedback by enabling developers to simpily provision, configure, and consume scalable backend services.  All future improvements will be channeled into Windows Azure Mobile Services rather than this toolkit.

Windows Azure Toolkit for iOS (Library)
===

The Windows Azure Toolkit for iOS is a toolkit for developers to make it easy to access Windows Azure storage services from native iOS applications.  The toolkit can be used for both iPhone and iPad applications, developed using Objective-C and XCode.  

The toolkit works in two ways – the toolkit can be used to access Windows Azure storage directly, or alternatively, can go through a proxy server.  The proxy server code is the same code as used in the WP7 toolkit for Windows Azure (found here) and negates the need for the developer to store the Azure storage credentials locally on the device.  If you are planning to test using the proxy server, you’ll need to download and deploy the services found in the [cloudreadypackages](https://github.com/microsoft-dpe/cloudreadypackages) here on GitHub.  

The Windows Azure Toolkit for iOS is made available as an open source product under the Apache License, Version 2.0.  

## Downloading the Configuration Utility

To download the configuration utility, select a download package (e.g. v1.2.0).  Alternatively, you can download the source and compile your own version.  The project file has been designed to work with XCode 4.
